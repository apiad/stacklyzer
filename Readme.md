> Simple Substack analytics from exported data.

This is a simple [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app that analyzes your Substack data (Settings -> Export) and provides several analyses and suggestions.

You can run it online for free [here](https://share.streamlit.io/apiad/stacklyzer/app.py).

To run it locally, clone the project, pip install the `requirements.txt` file and run `streamlit run app.py` on a terminal.
